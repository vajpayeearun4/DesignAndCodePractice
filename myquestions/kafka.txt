I asked 50+ software engineers this question during system design interviews, and only 40% gave a satisfactory answer. The question?

"Why is Kafka faster than RabbitMQ when multiple consumers need independent log traversal?"

► Why did I ask this?

1. It tests depth of knowledge.
 Anyone can say “Kafka is faster,” but can they explain why?

2. It highlights trade-off awareness.
 Engineers need to understand when to use Kafka vs RabbitMQ—not just pick one blindly.

3. It evaluates scalability thinking.
 Modern systems handle massive traffic and real-time data, so engineers must know how tools scale.

4. It reveals clarity in communication.
 Good engineers can explain complex systems simply, a skill that matters as much as technical depth.

► Now, let’s break down the answer:

 1. Message Handling Models

- RabbitMQ (Message Broker):
 - Uses queues with shared cursors, delivering each message to one consumer at a time.
 - Tracks locks on messages to manage “in-progress” status.
 - Deletes messages after they’re acknowledged or unlocks them for redelivery.

- Kafka (Log Ingestor):
 - Stores messages in a log and lets consumers manage their own cursors (offsets).
 - No lock management,consumers just pull messages based on offsets.
 - Keeps all messages until explicitly deleted, allowing multiple consumers to traverse logs independently.


 2. Compute Overhead

- RabbitMQ:
 - Supports filtering, deduplication, scheduling, and expiration.
 - These features require additional compute work and indexing, slowing throughput.

- Kafka:
 - Focuses purely on log storage and retrieval.
 - No filtering, locks, or deduplication,just sequential reads for maximum performance.

 3. Performance Bottlenecks

- RabbitMQ’s bottleneck:
 - Shared cursors and lock management create contention at the head of the queue.
 - This limits scaling when multiple consumers need the same data.

- Kafka’s advantage:
 - No locks, no shared cursors, just clients reading directly from the log.
 - Faster, parallel consumption for high-throughput scenarios.

Key Takeaways?

- RabbitMQ is great for task distribution, dispatching jobs to workers.
- Kafka shines in real-time data pipelines where multiple consumers need independent access to the same data.

The difference isn’t just “Kafka is faster.” It’s about how they handle data, manage state, and distribute work.

► Another question for you:

If your system needed deduplication and message ordering guarantees, would Kafka still be the right choice? Or would you rethink the architecture?

Think about it and don’t just memorize answers from the internet. Understand why.
