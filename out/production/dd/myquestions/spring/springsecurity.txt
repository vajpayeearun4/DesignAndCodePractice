Below are the few topics and tips for Spring Security which every Java Spring Boot Developer should know which will help to keep your app secure!

1. Authentication â€“ Verify User Identity
ðŸ‘‰ Implement authentication using form login or Basic Auth.
ðŸ‘‰ Use SecurityFilterChain instead of WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter (since Spring Security 6).
ðŸ‘‰ Store passwords securely using BCryptPasswordEncoder.

2. Authorization â€“ Restrict Access to Resources
ðŸ‘‰ Define URL-based access using .authorizeHttpRequests().
ðŸ‘‰ Secure methods with @PreAuthorize and @PostAuthorize.
ðŸ‘‰ Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to grant minimal required access.

3. CSRF Protection â€“ Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery
ðŸ‘‰ Enabled by default for stateful applications (e.g., form-based login).
ðŸ‘‰ Disable for stateless APIs and use JWT or OAuth2 instead.
ðŸ‘‰ Use CSRF tokens for form-based apps to prevent forged requests.

4. Password Encoding â€“ Store Passwords Securely
ðŸ‘‰ Always hash passwords using BCrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2.
ðŸ‘‰ Never store plaintext passwords in the database.

5. Security Context â€“ Manage Authenticated Users
ðŸ‘‰ Spring Security automatically tracks the logged-in user.
ðŸ‘‰ Use SecurityContextHolder to retrieve authentication details.
ðŸ‘‰ Avoid modifying security context manually unless necessary.

6. OAuth2 & OpenID Connect â€“ Secure External Logins
ðŸ‘‰ Integrate Google, GitHub, and other providers using Spring OAuth2.
ðŸ‘‰ Always store access tokens securely and never expose client secrets.

7. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) â€“ Stateless Authentication
ðŸ‘‰ Use JWT instead of session-based authentication for microservices.
ðŸ‘‰ Secure JWTs using HMAC or RSA signing and validate expiration.
ðŸ‘‰ Store tokens in HTTP-only cookies, not in localStorage.

8. Security Filters â€“ Process Requests Securely
ðŸ‘‰ Spring Security uses filter chains to apply security rules.
ðŸ‘‰ Add custom filters if needed (e.g., JWT validation, logging).

9. Method Security â€“ Secure Individual Methods
ðŸ‘‰ Use @EnableMethodSecurity instead of @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity.
ðŸ‘‰ Apply @PreAuthorize("hasRole('USER')") for fine-grained access control

10. Session Management â€“ Prevent Session Hijacking
ðŸ‘‰ Enable session fixation protection and configure session timeouts.
ðŸ‘‰ Use SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS for REST APIs.

11. Security Testing â€“ Ensure Configurations Are Working
ðŸ‘‰ Use Spring Security Test with @WithMockUser.
ðŸ‘‰ Automate security testing for vulnerabilities.
